# Interview Q&A - Logistic Regression

**Q1: What is Logistic Regression used for?**  
A supervised ML algorithm for **binary classification** problems.

**Q2: How does Logistic Regression differ from Linear Regression?**  
- Linear Regression predicts continuous values.  
- Logistic Regression predicts probabilities mapped to classes (0/1).

**Q3: What is the Sigmoid function?**  
A mathematical function that maps real numbers into the range (0, 1), used for probability estimation.

**Q4: How is model performance evaluated?**  
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

**Q5: Why did we get 100% accuracy here?**  
The two chosen Iris classes are **linearly separable**, making it trivial for Logistic Regression.
