# Lab 23: Introduction to Logistic Regression for Classification

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamental principles of Logistic Regression.
- Implement a Logistic Regression model using open-source tools.
- Evaluate the model's performance using standard accuracy metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Python environment with `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib` installed.
- Basic understanding of Python programming and ML concepts.

## Tasks
1. Load a binary classification dataset (Iris dataset, filtered to 2 classes).
2. Train a Logistic Regression model.
3. Evaluate model accuracy.
4. Display results.

## Conclusion
You successfully trained a Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset (binary classification).  
The model achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set.
