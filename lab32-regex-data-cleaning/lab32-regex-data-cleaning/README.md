# Lab 32 - Using Regular Expressions for Data Cleaning

## Objectives
- Understand regex fundamentals.
- Write patterns for text extraction and data cleaning.
- Use Python's re module for matching and replacement.
- Apply regex to clean and normalize datasets.

## Tasks Overview
1. **Simple Pattern Matching** — Extract phone numbers using `re.search()`.
2. **Email Extraction** — Find all emails using `re.findall()`.
3. **Text Cleaning** — Remove punctuation with `re.sub()`.
4. **Phone Normalization** — Standardize phone number formats.

## Expected Output
```
Matched text: 123-456-7890
Found emails: ['info@example.com', 'support@example.org']
Cleaned text: Hello This is a sample text Its meant for cleaning
Standardized phone numbers:
123-456-7890
123-456-7890
123-456-7890
```

## Conclusion
Regular expressions are essential for text preprocessing and data cleaning in machine learning and NLP.
