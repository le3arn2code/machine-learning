# Interview Q&A - Lab 17

### Q1: What is a histogram?
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data using bars.

### Q2: How do scatter plots help in analysis?
Scatter plots show relationships and correlations between two numerical variables.

### Q3: What does annotation in Matplotlib mean?
Annotation allows marking specific points in a plot with text and arrows for clarity.

### Q4: Why is bin size important in histograms?
The number of bins affects the granularity of the distribution; too few bins oversimplify, too many overcomplicate.

### Q5: What parameters are useful in scatter plots?
- `c` for color
- `marker` for shape of points
- `alpha` for transparency
