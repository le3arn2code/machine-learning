## Issue: Matplotlib Font Cache Delay
- When running Matplotlib for the first time, it may show:
  `Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.`

### Solution:
- This is normal and only happens once per VM or environment.
- Wait a few seconds for it to complete. Subsequent runs will be faster.
