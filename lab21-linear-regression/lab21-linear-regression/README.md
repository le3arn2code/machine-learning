# Lab 21: Building a Simple Linear Regression Model

## Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts of Linear Regression.
- Learn to implement a Simple Linear Regression model using open-source tools.
- Gain hands-on experience with Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
- Evaluate the performance of a Linear Regression model.

## Tasks
1. Load and inspect the dataset (California Housing dataset).
2. Split the dataset into features and target variables.
3. Train a Linear Regression model.
4. Make predictions and evaluate with **MSE** and **R²**.
5. Visualize actual vs. predicted prices.

## Conclusion
In this lab, we successfully built a Simple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.  
We explored dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, predictions, evaluation (MSE, R²), and visualization.
