# Interview Q&A

1. **Q: What is a loop in Python?**
   A: A loop allows repeated execution of a block of code.

2. **Q: Difference between for and while loops?**
   A: for iterates over a sequence, while repeats until a condition becomes false.

3. **Q: What is enumerate() used for?**
   A: To get both index and value while looping through a sequence.

4. **Q: Give a real-life analogy for loops.**
   A: Serving 5 guests food one by one instead of writing 5 serving instructions.

5. **Q: What happens if a while loop condition never becomes False?**
   A: It creates an infinite loop.

6. **Q: How do you stop a loop early in Python?**
   A: By using the `break` statement.

7. **Q: How do you skip an iteration?**
   A: Use the `continue` statement.

8. **Q: Can loops be nested?**
   A: Yes, a loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.

9. **Q: What are common use cases of loops?**
   A: Processing lists, iterating over strings, automating repeated tasks.

10. **Q: Why is iteration tracking useful?**
    A: Helps in debugging by showing the state at the start and end of each cycle.
