# Interview Q&A for Lab 15: Exploratory Data Analysis

**Q1: What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?**
- EDA is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.

**Q2: Why is handling missing values important?**
- Missing values can bias results or cause errors in analysis and model training. Handling them ensures data integrity.

**Q3: What is a correlation matrix and why is it useful?**
- A correlation matrix shows the relationships between numeric variables. It helps identify patterns, dependencies, and redundancy.

**Q4: What are common plots used in EDA?**
- Histograms (distribution), Boxplots (outliers and spread), Scatterplots (relationships), Heatmaps (correlation).

**Q5: How do you decide whether to impute or drop missing values?**
- Depends on dataset size, importance of the feature, and percentage of missing data. If small, drop; if large, impute with mean/median/mode.
