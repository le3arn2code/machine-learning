# Lab 37: Building a Custom Transformer in scikit-learn

### Objectives
- Understand the purpose of custom transformers in scikit-learn.
- Write and test your own custom transformer class.
- Integrate it into a pipeline for data preprocessing.

### Tasks Overview
1. Write a custom transformer class with `fit` and `transform` methods.
2. Implement logic to manipulate data (multiply and add transformations).
3. Test transformers inside a scikit-learn pipeline.

### Output
- Numeric transformation results are printed directly.
- Verified use of `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`.

### Files Included
- `lab37_custom_transformer.py`
- `commands.sh`
- `troubleshooting.md`
- `interview_qna.md`
- `/screenshots/lab37_output.png`
