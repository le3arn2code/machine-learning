# Lab 44: Visualizing Neural Network Training History

## Objectives
- Build and train a Keras model on a sample dataset.
- Track loss and accuracy during training.
- Visualize training and validation metrics using Matplotlib.

## Steps
1. Create and compile a simple Keras Sequential model.
2. Generate random training and validation data.
3. Train for 100 epochs, storing training history.
4. Plot both loss and accuracy curves using Matplotlib.

## Output
- figure2.png → Training and Validation Loss
- training_validation_accuracy.png → Training and Validation Accuracy

## Requirements
```
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy
```
