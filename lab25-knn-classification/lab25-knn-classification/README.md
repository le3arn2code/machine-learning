# Lab 25: Implementing k-Nearest Neighbors for Classification

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.
- Implement k-NN from scratch using scikit-learn.
- Experiment with different values of *k* to observe the impact on accuracy.
- Evaluate the model performance using accuracy metrics and visualization.

## Tasks Overview
1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and test sets.
3. Train and evaluate the k-NN model using scikit-learn.
4. Experiment with multiple *k* values (1–10) and record accuracy.
5. Visualize the performance trend.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrates how the choice of *k* affects the classifier’s performance.
By testing multiple *k* values, we observed that the accuracy remains stable for small *k* values and slightly decreases for higher ones.
