# Lab 31 - Basic Data Augmentation using Python

## Objectives
- Understand Data Augmentation concepts.
- Perform Image and Text Augmentation.
- Apply transformations such as rotation and flipping.
- Compare model performance with augmented data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3, Pillow, NumPy, OpenCV, NLTK installed.

## Outputs
- rotated_image.png (image rotated 90Â°)
- flipped_image.png (image flipped horizontally)
- augmented_text.txt (text after synonym replacement)

## Conclusion
Data augmentation helps models generalize better by providing more varied samples.
