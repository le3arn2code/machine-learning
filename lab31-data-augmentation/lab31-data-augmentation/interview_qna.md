# Interview Q&A - Lab 31

1. What is Data Augmentation?
   - Creating new data from existing data by adding transformations.

2. Why is it useful?
   - Increases data diversity and prevents overfitting.

3. What libraries can we use?
   - Pillow, OpenCV for images; NLTK for text.

4. What operations are common in image augmentation?
   - Rotation, flipping, scaling, cropping.

5. What is synonym replacement?
   - Replacing words with synonyms to create new text samples.

6. How does augmentation improve generalization?
   - Exposes models to variations of data, reducing bias.

7. Can augmentation degrade model performance?
   - Yes, if transformations distort meaningful features.

8. Why do we use WordNet in text augmentation?
   - It provides synonyms and word relationships.

9. What file formats are supported by PIL?
   - JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and more.

10. How is augmentation applied in NLP?
   - Synonym substitution, back translation, noise insertion, and shuffling.
