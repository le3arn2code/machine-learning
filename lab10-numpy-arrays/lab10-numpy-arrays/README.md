# Lab 10: Introduction to NumPy - Arrays and Operations

## Objectives
- Understand how to create and manipulate NumPy arrays
- Perform basic arithmetic operations on arrays
- Use indexing and slicing for effective data manipulation

## Steps Performed
1. Created 1D and 2D arrays using `numpy.array`.
2. Performed arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication) on arrays.
3. Used indexing and slicing to access specific elements and sub-arrays.

## Laymanâ€™s Explanation
Think of a NumPy array as a super-powered Python list. Unlike normal lists, arrays can perform fast math operations across all their elements at once (like adding or multiplying entire lists). You can also slice and index them just like lists, but with more flexibility for multiple dimensions.

## Issues Faced
- Initially, `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` occurred because NumPy was not installed.
- **Resolution:** Installed it using:
  ```bash
  pip3 install numpy --break-system-packages
  ```

## Conclusion
NumPy arrays provide efficient storage and mathematical operations on data. By learning arrays, arithmetic operations, and slicing, we took the first step into data science and numerical computing in Python.
