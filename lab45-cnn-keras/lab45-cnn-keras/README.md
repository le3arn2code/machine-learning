# Lab 45: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras

## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras on the MNIST dataset in a **headless environment** (ideal for cloud VMs).

### Objectives
- Understand the structure of CNNs (Convolutional, Pooling, Dense layers)
- Train a CNN using Keras and TensorFlow backend
- Evaluate model accuracy and loss
- Save training and validation curves

## Output Files
- **cnn_training_curves.png**: Saved training and validation accuracy/loss plot.

## Usage
Run the following commands to execute this lab:
```bash
chmod +x lab45_cnn_mnist.py
python3 lab45_cnn_mnist.py
```
