### Interview Q&A: SVM Fundamentals

**Q1:** What is the main goal of SVM?  
**A1:** To find the optimal hyperplane that best separates classes with maximum margin.

**Q2:** What are common SVM kernels?  
**A2:** Linear, Polynomial, RBF (Gaussian), and Sigmoid.

**Q3:** Why is feature scaling important for SVM?  
**A3:** SVM uses distance-based metrics; scaling ensures equal contribution from all features.

**Q4:** Difference between linear and RBF kernel?  
**A4:** Linear kernel works well on linearly separable data, while RBF handles non-linear relationships.
