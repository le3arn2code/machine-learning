# Lab 42: Building and Evaluating a Support Vector Machine Model

### Objectives
- Understand Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Train and evaluate an SVM model using scikit-learn
- Experiment with different kernel parameters
- Evaluate performance using confusion matrix and classification report

### How to Run
```bash
chmod +x lab42_svm_model.py
python3 lab42_svm_model.py
```

### Output
- Displays confusion matrix and classification reports for RBF, linear, and polynomial kernels.
- Results printed directly in the terminal.
