# Interview Q&A

**Q1: What is a Random Forest?**
A Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by averaging predictions.

**Q2: What are feature importances?**
They show how much each feature contributes to model predictions.

**Q3: How is Random Forest different from a single Decision Tree?**
It uses multiple trees trained on random subsets, leading to better generalization.

**Q4: How do you tune a Random Forest?**
Key parameters include `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.
