# Lab 43: Working with Neural Networks using Keras

## Overview
This lab introduces neural network implementation using **Keras Sequential API**.  
You will learn how to build, train, and evaluate a simple feedforward neural network on synthetic data.

## Objectives
- Build a Sequential model with Keras.
- Train a neural network on a random dataset.
- Evaluate training and test performance.
- Interpret model metrics.

## Files Included
- `lab43_keras_neural_network.py` — main Python script.
- `commands.sh` — execution steps.
- `troubleshooting.md` — fixes for common errors.
- `interview_qna.md` — 10 real-world interview Q&A.
- `/screenshots/lab43_output.png` — execution proof.

## Output Example
Refer to `/screenshots/lab43_output.png` for the actual console output.
