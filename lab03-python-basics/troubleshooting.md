# Troubleshooting

## Errors and Fixes

### 1. Duplicate Output
- **Cause:** The code was accidentally pasted twice in the file.
- **Solution:** Open the file in nano, remove duplicates, save again.

### 2. Python Version Mismatch
- **Cause:** Running with `python` used version 2.x which caused errors.
- **Solution:** Always run with `python3 lab03_variables.py`.

### 3. File Not Saved in nano
- **Cause:** Exiting nano without saving.
- **Solution:** In nano, press `CTRL+O` (save), then `CTRL+X` (exit).

### 4. NameError
- **Cause:** Trying to print a variable that was not declared.
- **Solution:** Ensure all variables are defined before printing.
