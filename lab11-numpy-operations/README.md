# Lab 11: NumPy Array Operations and Slicing

## Objectives
- Understand and apply basic and advanced array slicing techniques.
- Perform vectorized operations on NumPy arrays for efficient computation.
- Learn to reshape NumPy arrays to fit various data needs and ensure dimensional compatibility.

## Files
- `lab11_slicing.py` → Demonstrates slicing on multi-dimensional arrays.
- `lab11_vectorized.py` → Performs vectorized element-wise and broadcasting operations.
- `lab11_reshaping.py` → Reshapes, flattens, and transposes arrays.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 lab11_slicing.py
python3 lab11_vectorized.py
python3 lab11_reshaping.py
```

## Expected Output
- Demonstrates array slicing, vectorized arithmetic, reshaping, flattening, and transposing.
