# Interview Q&A - Lab 11: NumPy Array Operations and Slicing

**Q1: What is slicing in NumPy arrays?**
A1: Slicing allows you to extract a portion of an array using indices. It is useful for subsetting data.

**Q2: What are vectorized operations?**
A2: Operations applied directly on arrays without loops, making them faster and more efficient.

**Q3: What is broadcasting in NumPy?**
A3: Broadcasting allows arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes by expanding one array's dimensions.

**Q4: Difference between reshape and flatten?**
A4: `reshape` changes the shape into multi-dimensions, while `flatten` converts it into a 1D array.

**Q5: How does transpose help in array manipulation?**
A5: Transpose switches rows and columns, useful in linear algebra and matrix transformations.
