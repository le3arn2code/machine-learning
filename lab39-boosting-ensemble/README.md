# Lab 39: Introduction to Ensemble Methods — Boosting with Python

### Objective
Understand and implement boosting using AdaBoostClassifier in scikit-learn, then compare it with Bagging and Stacking.

### Files Included
- `lab39_boosting_ensemble.py` — Full executable script
- `commands.sh` — Step-by-step run guide
- `troubleshooting.md` — Common fixes
- `interview_qna.md` — Conceptual and practical interview prep
- `/screenshots/` — Output evidence

### Output Preview
Refer to `screenshots/lab39_output.png` for execution results.

### Key Learnings
- Ensemble methods reduce bias and variance.
- AdaBoost improves model performance by combining weak learners.
- Comparison with Bagging and Stacking provides insight into ensemble diversity.
