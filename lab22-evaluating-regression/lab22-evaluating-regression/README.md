# Lab 22: Evaluating Regression Models

## Objectives
- Understand the key metrics used to evaluate regression models.
- Learn to make predictions using a trained regression model.
- Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
- Visualize predictions against actual values to assess model performance.

## Tasks
1. Load and split dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Train a regression model (Linear Regression).
3. Make predictions on test data.
4. Calculate MSE and R² score.
5. Plot predictions vs actual values.

## Conclusion
By completing this lab, you have learned to evaluate regression models using MSE and R² score, and to visualize predictions to better understand model performance.
