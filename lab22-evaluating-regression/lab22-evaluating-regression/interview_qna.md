# Interview Q&A

**Q: What is MSE?**  
A: Mean Squared Error measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower = better.

**Q: What is R² score?**  
A: R² indicates how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model. Closer to 1 = better fit.

**Q: Why evaluate with multiple metrics?**  
A: MSE emphasizes magnitude of errors, while R² explains variance captured. Both are complementary.

**Q: Can linear regression overfit?**  
A: Yes, especially with many correlated features. Regularization (Ridge, Lasso) helps.
