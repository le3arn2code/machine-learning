# Interview Q&A - Lab 47 (NLTK Basics)

1. **What is NLP?**
   It’s a field of AI enabling machines to understand and process human language.

2. **What is tokenization?**
   Splitting text into smaller pieces like words or sentences.

3. **What is a stopword?**
   Common words like “the”, “and”, “is” that are often removed.

4. **Why do we use stemming?**
   To reduce words to their root form for better matching.

5. **Which stemmer did we use?**
   PorterStemmer.

6. **What library is used for NLP in this lab?**
   NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).

7. **Why do we download datasets with nltk.download()?**
   To ensure required corpora (like stopwords, tokenizers) are locally available.

8. **How can we visualize word frequency?**
   Using Python collections like `Counter` or libraries like `matplotlib`.

9. **Difference between stemming and lemmatization?**
   Stemming cuts off word ends, lemmatization uses vocabulary and grammar rules.

10. **How can these techniques help in real projects?**
    They are used in chatbots, search engines, text classification, and sentiment analysis.
