# 🧠 Machine Learning Labs Series

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Labs Series** — a comprehensive, hands-on learning journey covering the **foundations, mathematics, data preprocessing, model building, and deep learning** essentials of modern AI.

This repository contains **50 structured labs**, each building upon the previous one to guide learners from **Python fundamentals** all the way to **end-to-end machine learning workflows**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each lab follows a consistent and GitHub-ready format:

```
labXX-topic/
├── labXX_<topic>.py              # Main lab script
├── README.md                     # Lab overview and objectives
├── commands.sh                   # CLI commands used in the lab
├── troubleshooting.md             # Common issues and fixes
├── interview_qna.md               # 10 real-world interview Q&As
└── screenshots/                  # Actual output visuals
```

Each folder is self-contained and can be executed independently.
