# Lab 48: Text Vectorization with CountVectorizer and TF-IDF

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand text vectorization and its importance in NLP.
- Implement `CountVectorizer` for basic text vectorization.
- Apply TF-IDF to measure word importance.
- Compare outputs of CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.

## 🧠 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## ⚙️ Tasks
### Task 1: Apply CountVectorizer
Convert text into a matrix of token counts using `CountVectorizer`.

### Task 2: Apply TF-IDF
Compute TF-IDF weights using `TfidfTransformer`.

### Task 3: Compare Outputs
Examine differences between Count Matrix and TF-IDF Matrix.

## 📊 Output
Results saved to `/screenshots/lab48_output.txt`

## 🏁 Conclusion
CountVectorizer counts word frequency, while TF-IDF adjusts importance based on occurrence across documents. Together, they form the foundation for NLP feature extraction.
