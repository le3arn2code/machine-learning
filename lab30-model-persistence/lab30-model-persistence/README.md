# Lab 30 - Introduction to Model Persistence with Joblib

## Objectives
- Understand model persistence.
- Use Joblib to save and load trained models.
- Implement model persistence with scikit-learn.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3, NumPy, scikit-learn, and joblib installed.

## Tasks
### 1. Train a Simple Model
Train a Random Forest classifier using the Iris dataset.

### 2. Save the Model
Persist the trained model using Joblib into `random_forest_model.pkl`.

### 3. Reload and Predict
Load the saved model and make predictions on the test set.

## Conclusion
You learned to train, save, and reload ML models efficiently using Joblib, a crucial step for deploying models in production.
