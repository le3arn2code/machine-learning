# Lab 28 - Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets

## Objectives
- Understand why splitting datasets is essential.
- Use `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
- Differentiate between training and testing data.
- Choose appropriate split ratios based on dataset size.

## Tasks
1. Use `train_test_split` with the Iris dataset.
2. Verify data shapes after splitting.
3. Explain training vs testing roles.
4. Validate split ratios and stratification.

## Conclusion
Proper data splitting ensures fair model evaluation and prevents overfitting.
