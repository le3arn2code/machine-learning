# Interview Q&A

1. **Q: What is the purpose of control structures in Python?**
   A: They direct the flow of a program, making decisions and repeating tasks.

2. **Q: What is the difference between if, elif, and else?**
   A: if checks the first condition, elif checks additional conditions, else runs if none are true.

3. **Q: Give a real-life analogy for an if-else statement.**
   A: "If it's raining, take an umbrella, else wear sunglasses."

4. **Q: What is the difference between for and while loops?**
   A: for loops run a fixed number of times, while loops run until a condition is false.

5. **Q: When would you use a while loop instead of a for loop?**
   A: When the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

6. **Q: What happens if the condition in a while loop never becomes false?**
   A: The loop runs forever (infinite loop).

7. **Q: How do you safely take user input in Python?**
   A: Use `input()` and convert to the right type (int, float, str).

8. **Q: What is a common error with input()?**
   A: Entering letters instead of numbers when an integer is expected.

9. **Q: Can for loops iterate over things other than numbers?**
   A: Yes, lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, etc.

10. **Q: How can you break out of a loop early?**
    A: By using the `break` statement.
