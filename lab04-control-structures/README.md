# Lab 4: Python Basics - Control Structures

## Objectives
- Understand and apply basic control structures in Python.
- Use if-else conditions to manipulate flow.
- Implement for and while loops for iteration.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python syntax.
- Familiarity with Python variables and data types.

## Tasks and Files

### Task 1: If-Else Conditions
- `lab04_if.py`: Simple if statement
- `lab04_if_else.py`: If + else condition
- `lab04_if_elif_else.py`: If + elif + else conditions

### Task 2: Loops
- `lab04_for_loop.py`: For loop example
- `lab04_while_loop.py`: While loop example

### Task 3: User Input Condition
- `lab04_input_check.py`: Even or odd check

### Case Study: Inventory Restock
- `lab04_inventory.py`: Inventory threshold check

## Layman's Explanation
This lab teaches how to **control the flow** of your program.  
Think of it like making decisions in daily life:
- "If it’s raining, take an umbrella, else don’t."
- "If temperature > 25, say it's warm, else it's cool."  

Loops are like repeating tasks:
- For loop: "Do this 5 times."
- While loop: "Keep doing this until the counter reaches 5."  

By combining these, we can build smart programs that **react to conditions and repeat tasks** automatically.

## Issues Faced and Fixes

1. **Filename consistency**  
   - Issue: Missed underscores or typos caused `File not found` errors.  
   - Fix: Used consistent naming `lab04_<task>.py`.

2. **Python version mismatch**  
   - Issue: Running with `python` (Python 2.x) caused errors.  
   - Fix: Always use `python3 filename.py`.

3. **Input Handling**  
   - Issue: When entering invalid input (like letters instead of numbers), the program crashed.  
   - Fix: Restrict input to integers using `int(input(...))`.

## Conclusion
By completing this lab, you practiced how to use:
- **if-else** for decisions,
- **for/while loops** for repetition,
- **input handling** for interactivity,
- **real-life case study** for inventory management.  

These are the building blocks for all future programming!
