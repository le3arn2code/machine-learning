# Interview Q&A

1. **Q: What is the difference between a list and a tuple?**
   A: Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.

2. **Q: When would you use a tuple instead of a list?**
   A: When data should not change, like coordinates or config values.

3. **Q: Can lists and tuples store different data types?**
   A: Yes, both can hold mixed data types.

4. **Q: How do you add elements to a list?**
   A: Using `append()` or `insert()`.

5. **Q: How do you remove elements from a list?**
   A: Using `remove()` by value or `pop()` by index.

6. **Q: How do you access elements in tuples?**
   A: By indexing, e.g., `tuple[0]`.

7. **Q: Why are tuples more memory-efficient?**
   A: Because they are immutable and optimized internally.

8. **Q: What error occurs if you try to change a tuple element?**
   A: `TypeError`.

9. **Q: Can tuples be used as dictionary keys?**
   A: Yes, because they are immutable. Lists cannot.

10. **Q: Give a real-world analogy of mutability vs immutability.**
    A: A shopping cart (list) vs a printed receipt (tuple).
