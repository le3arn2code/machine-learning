# Lab 01: Introduction to Python for ML

## Overview
This lab introduces Python as the foundation for Machine Learning (ML). Python is widely used because it is simple, readable, and has strong community support. Its extensive libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn make it the go-to language for ML tasks.

In this lab, you learned how to install Python, set up a development environment, install and verify ML libraries, and write your very first script: `Hello, ML`. These steps build the foundation for more advanced ML projects.

## Lab Goals
- Understand Python’s importance in ML.
- Install Python and key ML libraries.
- Create and execute a Python script.
- Verify ML libraries’ installation and versions.

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Python and verified version using `python3 --version`.
2. Installed ML libraries using pip: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Verified library versions by importing them in Python and printing their version numbers.
4. Created `hello_ml.py` with the content:
   ```python
   print("Hello, ML")
   ```
5. Executed the script using `python3 hello_ml.py`.
6. Successfully saw output `Hello, ML` in the terminal.

## Final Outcome
- Python and ML libraries were successfully installed.
- A basic Python script ran correctly.
- Output was displayed as expected (see screenshot).

## Errors Encountered
No critical errors encountered. Used `python3` instead of `python` since default system mapping was different.

## Software Stack
- Python 3.8+
- Pip (default package manager)
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn libraries
- IDE: MobaXterm terminal (or Jupyter/PyCharm optional)
