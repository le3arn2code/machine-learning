# Interview Q&A - Lab 01

**Q1. Why is Python preferred for Machine Learning?**  
A1. Python is simple, readable, and has a rich ecosystem of ML libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

**Q2. What is the difference between Python and other languages in ML?**  
A2. Python has more ML libraries and is beginner-friendly, while languages like R are more statistical, and Java/C++ are harder but faster.

**Q3. What is NumPy used for in ML?**  
A3. NumPy is used for efficient numerical computations, arrays, and linear algebra operations.

**Q4. What is Pandas used for in ML?**  
A4. Pandas provides powerful tools for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.

**Q5. What is Scikit-learn used for?**  
A5. Scikit-learn provides ready-to-use ML algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and evaluation.

**Q6. What is the difference between python and python3 commands?**  
A6. `python` may point to Python 2.x on some systems, while `python3` ensures youâ€™re running Python 3.x.

**Q7. What are Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) useful for in ML?**  
A7. IDEs like Jupyter or PyCharm provide user-friendly interfaces, debugging tools, and visualization support.

**Q8. How do you check which version of a library is installed?**  
A8. Import the library in Python and print its `__version__` attribute.

**Q9. What are common installation issues with Python libraries?**  
A9. Missing pip, version conflicts, or OS dependencies. These can be resolved by upgrading pip or using virtual environments.

**Q10. What does the script `hello_ml.py` demonstrate?**  
A10. It demonstrates basic Python syntax, execution, and environment verification for ML readiness.
